# My Markdown Audiobook

## Chapter 1: The Beginning
This is **bold** text and this is *italic* text. 
Here is a [link](https://example.com) that should be read as just "link".
Here is some `inline code` and a block:
```python
print("Hello")
```
The block should be skipped.

## Chapter 2: Conclusion
> This is a blockquote.
It should be read without the arrow symbol. 
List items:
* Item one
* Item two
The audiobook should sound clean.

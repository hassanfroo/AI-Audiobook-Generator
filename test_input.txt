It contains some academic markers that should be removed by the text cleaner.
For instance, citations like [1] or [2, 3, 4] should be ignored.
Also, parenthetical citations such as (Sonia, 2026) or (Ryan et al., 2025) should not be read.

Finally, it should skip URLs like https://www.google.com and figure references like Figure 1.2.
